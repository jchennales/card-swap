# card-swap
Tool to swap cards amongst many people

This is a very crude tool to attempt to match cards wanted by someone with cards offered by others in a swapping team
The idea is that it can achieve multi-member matches that would not be possible one on one.
I wrote this for kicks to help my 7 year old fill his Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup sticker album with his friends.
I am sure there are books on how to properly do this but I didn't bother even searching for it. This is a very crude brute-force match with a bunch of nested loops that will surely not scale nicely.
If you want to use this for something go ahead, just send me a mail or credit me if appropriate.
